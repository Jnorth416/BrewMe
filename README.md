# BrewMe

## Description

- My motivation behind this app was to create something interesting to use while traveling.
- I built this project to challenge myself and further progress my knowledge of app development
- This app primarily focuses on finding breweries based on the users location. Instead of having to filter through a wide range of restaurants and bars it will find only breweries local to you.
- What i learned about this app is that theres always room for improvement and how much pride i have for something i can call my own.

## Installation 

In order to install this app you can download the zip file from the Git repository. Another option is to duplicate the project.

## Usage

Brewery Type: This is the root view of the app. In this view you are able to search for breweries by type in a search box. There is a list of brewery types in a collection that the user you can scroll through and click. Wether you click on the types or use the search function a list of them will appear where the user can favorite by sliding the cell and pressing the favorite button. The user can also click on the cell to be directed to the breweries website to find information about it.

Brewery Map: The brewery map shows the user what breweries are located near them. In order to center the map to focus back on the user a current location button can be pressed. If you find a brewery you liked or want more information you can click on the pin. When you click on the pin an information button appears that can be clicked to be directed to the website. There is also a favorite button to add to favorites.

Favorites: The favorties page displays the list of favorites that user has selected. If a user accidentally favorites an item they can delete them here by sliding the cell and pressing the delete button.

## Features
